## Instructions

1. Implement the functions in `list_operations.py`. The comments and function signatures give an indication of what each function should do.

2. Run the unit tests using the command 

```shell
python -m unittest test_list_operations.py
```

All tests should pass when the list operations are correctly implemented.
