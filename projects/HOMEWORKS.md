Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.

### Factorial Calculation
Write a program that computes the factorial of a given number using a loop.

### Reverse a String
Create a program that takes a string as input and prints the reverse of that string.

### Check for Prime Number
Write a program that checks if a given number is prime or not.

### FizzBuzz
Implement the FizzBuzz problem: For numbers from 1 to 100, print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5. Otherwise, print the number.

### Sum of Digits
Write a program that takes an integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.

### Leap Year Checker
Create a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless they are also divisible by 400.

### Multiplication Table
Write a program that generates and prints the multiplication table for a given number (up to a certain range).

### GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
Implement a program that finds and prints the greatest common divisor of two given numbers.

### Power of a Number
Write a program that calculates the result of raising a number to a given power (both inputs provided by the user).

### List Reversal
Create a program that reverses a list without using any built-in functions.

### Remove Duplicates
Write a program that removes duplicates from a list while preserving the order of the original list.

### Count Vowels and Consonants
Implement a program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a given string (case-insensitive).

### Prime Number Generator
Write a program that generates and prints a list of prime numbers within a given range.

### Palindrome List
Write a program that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing only the palindromes from the original list.

### Fibonacci Sequence
Create a program that generates and prints the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where n is given as input.

### Anagram Checker
Implement a program that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other (i.e., they have the same characters in different orders).

### Matrix Transposition
Write a program that transposes a given matrix (2D list), switching rows with columns.

### Factorization
Create a program that factors a given positive integer and prints its prime factors.

### Reverse Words in a Sentence
Write a program that reverses the words in a sentence. For example, "Hello, World!" should become "World! Hello,".

### List Intersection
Implement a program that finds and prints the common elements between two lists.

### Decimal to Binary Converter
Create a program that converts a decimal number to its binary representation.

### Sum of Squares vs. Square of Sum
Write a program that calculates and prints the difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers, where n is given as input.

### Email Validator
Implement a program that checks if a given string is a valid email address based on a simple set of rules (e.g., it contains an "@" symbol and a "." character in the right positions).

### Pascal's Triangle
Write a program that generates and prints the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle, where n is given as input.

### Matrix Multiplication
Create a program that performs matrix multiplication for two given matrices and prints the result.

### Common Characters in Strings
Write a program that finds and prints the common characters between two strings (case-sensitive).

### Armstrong Number Checker
Implement a program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is one where the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits, is equal to the number itself.

### String Compression
Create a program that compresses a given string by replacing consecutive duplicate characters with the character followed by the count.

### Vigenère Cipher
Implement a program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Vigenère cipher. Allow the user to input a keyword for encryption and decryption.

### Prime Number Checker
Write a program that checks if a given number is prime using the trial division method.

### Count Substrings
Create a program that counts the occurrences of a given substring within a larger string.

### Largest Palindrome Product
Write a program that finds and prints the largest palindrome that is a product of two three-digit numbers.

### Sum of Primes
Create a program that calculates and prints the sum of all prime numbers below a given limit.

### Quadratic Equation Solver
Write a program that takes coefficients (a, b, and c) of a quadratic equation as input and calculates its real roots using the quadratic formula.
